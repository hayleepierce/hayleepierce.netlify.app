This chapter of _Fuzzing Book_ ("Fuzzing: Breaking Things with Random Inputs") covers the topic of **fuzzing**. Fuzzing is the process of creating random inputs to use with programs to see if they cause any issues. The inputs are made up of a bunch of random characters and, typically, millions of different inputs are created and used as inputs for a program. Although, this type of testing is unstable and has the potential for changing and/or damaging you system. It is recommended that all fuzz tests be run in a safe environment; for example, in a Docker container.

This chapter has some useful information we could use in class. We could implement the ideas of fuzzing into the tests for our programs.
