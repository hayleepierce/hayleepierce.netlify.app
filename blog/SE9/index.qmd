The ["Code Review"](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch09.html) chapter of _Software Engineering_ discusses the importance of reviewing code.

_Code reviews_ involve having the author of the code submitting it for review to one or more reviewers. The reviewer(s) will tag the change as "looks good to me," or **LGTM**, denoting that the change is approved. At Google there are three different reviews that have to give a LGTM before a change can be implemented. All three of these reviews can be done by one or more people:

1. Another engineer (often a team member) verifies that the code is appropriate and does what the author claims.

2. One of the code owners verifies that the code is appropriate for this part of the codebase.

3. Someone with language "readability" verifies that the code conforms to the language's style and best practices.

While these code review requirements do slow down the development of projects, the benefits far out-weighs the negatives. Here is a list of benefits code reviews can provide: 

- Ensures:
    - Code Correctness
    - Comprehension of Code
    - Code Consistency
- Promotes:
    - Team Ownership
    - Knowledge Sharing
- Provides a History

We already do this in both of our project. We require approval from the _Chief Sofware Architect_, a _Technical Leader_ or the professor, and a class member. This chapter can be used to improve the review process we already have in place. It also allows us to undstand _why_ we have this process in place and how it benefits us.
