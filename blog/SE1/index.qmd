The preface of _Software Engineering at Google_ describes what the goals of most software organizations are. The main goal stated is to write code that is **sustainable**. Making code sustainable means that the engineers must keep in mind what updates will need to be made over time, as well as making sure those changes can be implemented without causing issues. The engineers must be able to make difficult decisions about what to updates to implement based off trade-offs. 

This preface empasizes the importance of sustainable code. We, as a software startup, should think out this while developing our tools. With how fast the industry changes, a company must ensure their code can change with the industry.
